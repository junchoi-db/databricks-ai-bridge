# Agent — LangGraph (FastAPI)

A [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) agent **backend** for Databricks Apps,
served from a **FastAPI app** — no serving framework. It runs locally with **no
database and no setup** — just an auth profile. It speaks LangGraph's **native** shape on both ends:
`POST /invocations` takes an `input` list of LangChain message dicts (streaming via SSE, plus an
in-memory `background` mode with `GET /invocations/{id}`) and returns LangChain messages — nothing is
reshaped into another contract.

The HTTP surface is hand-written in `runtime/runtime.py` (routes, SSE framing, tracing spans,
background wiring), so the template shows exactly how the agent is served — request and response
bodies are plain dicts, no wrapper types.

This template is API-first. Call it with `curl` or use it from your own client.

Local clients can use `/invocations`. For a deployed Databricks App, use the equivalent
`/api/invocations` route with an OAuth Bearer token; Databricks Apps reserves `/api/*` for
programmatic token authentication. Polling and health checks likewise have `/api` aliases.

## Project layout

```
agent/                 # the agent (reasoning plane) — this is what you edit
  agent.py             #   invoke / stream handlers + create_agent_graph() + event serialization
  databricks_tools.py  #   Sandbox, managed MCP, and UC Function selections (ordinary Python)
  tools/               #   function tools — drop a *.py file here to add one (auto-collected)
    sample_tool.py     #     get_current_time — a working example (@tool)
    send_message.py    #     a side-effecting tool gated by human approval (see REQUIRE_APPROVAL)
  mcps.py              #   MCP servers: none by default; add to build_mcp_servers() to offer some
runtime/               # the HTTP surface — SDK-agnostic; rarely edited
  runtime.py           #   build_app(): FastAPI routes, SSE framing, tracing spans, background wiring
  main.py              #   entry point: loads config, builds the app, runs uvicorn
tests/
  test_agent.py        #   hermetic smoke tests + one gated live model call
```

You edit `agent/agent.py`, `agent/databricks_tools.py`, `agent/tools/`, and `agent/mcps.py`; the
plumbing (session checkpointer, tracing, MCP tool loading, background store) lives in the
`databricks-mason` package —
framework-neutral pieces under `databricks_mason.runtime`, LangGraph-specific ones under
`databricks_mason.langgraph` — so the template ships only your agent code. `runtime/runtime.py` is the
SDK-agnostic HTTP surface — it wires two generic handlers (`invoke_handler`/`stream_handler`) to the
endpoints, so the agent SDK lives entirely behind them in `agent/agent.py`. `tools/` is a drop-in
package: add a `*.py` with a `@tool` function and it's auto-collected (no edits to existing code).
`databricks_tools.py` is an empty, importable registry until `mason tools add` writes a descriptor;
the active `await load_tools(DATABRICKS_TOOLS, ...)` seam in `create_agent_graph()` makes empty input
a no-op. `mcps.py` exposes `build_mcp_servers()` for custom MCP connections and is empty by default.

## Run locally

No database required. Conversation state is kept in an in-process LangGraph checkpointer.

```bash
# 1. Configure a Databricks auth profile (used only to call the model)
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: set DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE=<your-profile>

# 2. Start the server (installs deps via uv on first run)
uv run start-server        # serves at http://localhost:8000

# 3. Send a request
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/invocations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": [{"role": "user", "content": "What time is it? Use your tool."}]}'
```

The model call goes to your Databricks workspace (via the profile). Everything else — session
storage, tracing — is off by default and requires no setup.

## Client contract

The Databricks Apps `__Host-databricks-app-router` cookie is the single session identifier. It both
keeps requests on the same App replica and keys LangGraph checkpoints, HITL resumes, and Session
Store records. Do **not** send `session_id` in request bodies. The runtime ignores
an old body value and injects the cookie value before calling the agent. Browsers resend the Apps
cookie automatically; API clients must preserve it in a cookie jar. Localhost has no Apps router, so
the server sets an HTTP-only `mason-local-session` fallback cookie instead.

TODO: switch the client contract to `X-Routing-Key` when Databricks Apps supports it. Until then use
the [documented Apps routing cookie](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/horizontal-scaling#api-clients).

```bash
curl -X POST "https://<app>.databricksapps.com/invocations" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b "__Host-databricks-app-router=<routing-key>" \
  -d '{"input":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}'
```

The examples below use a localhost cookie jar so every request addresses the same session:

```bash
BASE=http://localhost:8000
COOKIE_JAR=/tmp/mason-agent.cookies
curl -s -c "$COOKIE_JAR" "$BASE/health"
```

When the chat app is enabled, `GET /api/demo/config` returns the resolved `session_id`, process
`instance_id`, the signed-in viewer, and the enabled state for streaming, background, Session Store,
and Memory Store. The UI uses this response to color capability indicators automatically. Only the
sync/streaming/background selector is a manual client choice.

**Non-streaming:**

```bash
curl -s -b "$COOKIE_JAR" -X POST "$BASE/invocations" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}'
```

The response is `{ "output": [...], "session_id": "...", "status": "completed" }`. `output`
contains native LangChain message dictionaries.

**Streaming** adds `"stream": true` and returns SSE. Completed messages use
`data: {"type":"message","message":{...}}`; token chunks use
`data: {"type":"delta","content":"...","id":"..."}`; interruptions use
`data: {"type":"interrupt",...}`; the final frame is `data: [DONE]`.

```bash
curl -sN -b "$COOKIE_JAR" -X POST "$BASE/invocations" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input":[{"role":"user","content":"Count to three"}],"stream":true}'
```

**Background** (add `"background": true`) returns an `inv_...` id immediately; poll it:

```bash
curl -s -b "$COOKIE_JAR" -X POST "$BASE/invocations" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input":[{"role":"user","content":"do something"}],"background":true}'
# -> {"id":"inv_...","status":"in_progress"}

curl -s -b "$COOKIE_JAR" "$BASE/invocations/inv_..."
# -> in_progress, completed + output, or failed + error
```

Background runs and polling are in-memory and single-process. The routing cookie is required so the
poll reaches the same replica, but the run itself does not survive a restart.

### Chat app state APIs

When initialized with the chat app (the default for `mason init --framework langgraph`, unless
`--disable-chat-app` is passed), the browser also calls:

- `POST /api/session/new` to generate a fresh session id and replace the routing cookie. The request
  has no body-level `session_id`; the response includes the new and previous ids.
- `POST /api/demo/sessions` to create or resolve the current cookie-backed managed session.
- `GET /api/demo/sessions` to list recent sessions for the configured actor. In local in-memory mode
  it returns only the current browser session.
- `POST /api/demo/sessions/{session_id}/open` to verify an actor-scoped managed session, replace the
  routing cookie, and load that session's transcript and pending state.
- `GET /api/demo/session/items` to load the current transcript. Without a managed Session Store it
  reconstructs messages and pending interrupts from the in-process LangGraph checkpoint. Managed
  responses filter out checkpoint fragments before returning items to the UI.
- `POST /api/demo/session/items` to mirror user, assistant, tool, and human-decision items into the
  managed Session Store.
- `GET /api/demo/memory/entries`, `POST /api/demo/memory/entries`, and
  `POST /api/demo/memory/search` for managed long-term memory. Created entries are tagged with the
  current cookie-backed session id; actor partitioning comes from `AGENT_MEMORY_ACTOR_ID`.

### Human-in-the-loop (tool approval)

Tools named in `REQUIRE_APPROVAL` (in `agent/agent.py`) pause for human approval before they run. The
template ships with one gated demo tool, `send_message` — ask the agent to send a message and instead
of running the tool, the run **pauses** and emits an `interrupt` event describing the pending call:

```json
{ "type": "interrupt", "id": "int_...",
  "value": { "action_requests": [{ "name": "send_message",
             "args": { "recipient": "alice@x.com", "body": "hi" } }], "review_configs": [...] } }
```

The paused run is checkpointed on the cookie-backed session thread. **Resume** with the same cookie
and a native LangGraph `resume` payload — one decision per pending call:

```bash
# Approve — the tool runs
curl -s -b "$COOKIE_JAR" -X POST "$BASE/invocations" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"resume":{"decisions":[{"type":"approve"}]}}'

# Reject — the tool is skipped; the message is fed back to the model
#   { "type": "reject", "message": "Not allowed." }
# Edit — run the tool with changed args
#   { "type": "edit", "edited_action": { "name": "send_message", "args": { "recipient": "...", "body": "..." } } }
# Respond — answer on the tool's behalf without running it
#   { "type": "respond", "message": "..." }
```

Non-streaming replies to a gated turn come back with `"status": "interrupted"` and the `interrupt`
event as the last `output` item; approved/rejected resumes return `"status": "completed"`.

To gate more tools, add their names to `REQUIRE_APPROVAL`; empty the dict to disable approval
entirely. Which decisions are allowed per tool is configurable — see LangChain's
`HumanInTheLoopMiddleware`.

> Like sessions, a paused run lives in the checkpointer — **in-memory and single-process** by default,
> so it survives only within the running process. Back the checkpointer with a durable store (below)
> for pauses that survive restarts / span replicas.

**Multi-turn** needs no body bookkeeping: reuse the same cookie jar for each turn.

```bash
curl -s -b "$COOKIE_JAR" -X POST "$BASE/invocations" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input":[{"role":"user","content":"My name is Alice"}]}'
curl -s -b "$COOKIE_JAR" -X POST "$BASE/invocations" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input":[{"role":"user","content":"What is my name?"}]}'
```

## Customize the agent

- **Model / instructions:** `create_agent_graph()` in `agent/agent.py`.
- **Add a tool:** drop a new file in `agent/tools/` with a `@tool`-decorated function; it's
  collected automatically (see `agent/tools/sample_tool.py`). No wiring to edit.
- **Add a Databricks integration:** run `mason tools add sandbox`, `mason tools add mcp`, or
  `mason tools add uc-function`. The CLI updates `agent/databricks_tools.py` and reports its exact
  definition and active attachment lines. Choose `--auth user|app` when adding Sandbox or MCP;
  both default to request-user auth. `app` is the dedicated App service principal, never the
  creator. UC Function and custom servers in `build_mcp_servers()` keep their existing credentials.
- **Require approval for a tool:** add its name to `REQUIRE_APPROVAL` in `agent/agent.py` (see the
  human-in-the-loop section above); empty the dict to disable gating.
- **Add a custom MCP server:** append a `DatabricksMCPServer` to `build_mcp_servers()` in
  `agent/mcps.py`; it is passed as an explicit extra server at the same construction seam.
- **Make state durable:** set `AGENT_SESSION_STORE` (see "Enable durable state" below); the
  checkpointer lives in `databricks_mason/langgraph/session_store.py`.
- **Add long-term memory:** set `AGENT_MEMORY_STORE` to a managed memory store ID; `create_agent_graph()`
  then includes the `remember`/`recall` tools from `databricks_mason/langgraph/memory.py` (persist/search facts across
  conversations). Unset → the model isn't offered them.
- **Change the HTTP surface:** `runtime/runtime.py` — routes, SSE framing, background wiring (the run
  store itself is `databricks_mason/runtime/background.py`).

## Test

```bash
uv run pytest                 # hermetic smoke tests (tools, session, event serialization)
```

The smoke tests need no auth. `tests/test_agent.py` also has one end-to-end test that calls the
model; it runs only when a workspace profile is configured (`DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE` or
`DATABRICKS_HOST`+`DATABRICKS_TOKEN`) and skips otherwise.

## Deploy

Deploy with the [Mason](../../README.md) CLI:

```bash
mason deploy agent-langgraph --source .
```

Add `--memory <name> --session <name> --actor-id <actor>` to wire managed state. Mason
provisions or resolves the stores (creating them if missing), injects the store/actor env vars, and
deploys the App.

`app.yaml` carries the app's start command and env. By default the deployed app is the same lean
backend: in-process session state, tracing off.

For `auth="user"` Sandbox or managed MCP tools, Mason configures the App's `ai-gateway` user API
scope and the runtime uses the Apps-forwarded caller credential. Browser/workspace callers may need
to leave and re-enter the App and consent again after that scope changes; external OAuth callers
must refresh a token covering the App's scopes. Missing or invalid scoped user auth fails closed and
never falls back to the App service principal. User-auth tools are foreground-only; submit
`background: true` only from an App-only integration registry.
During local development, `auth="app"` uses the selected profile; only a deployed Databricks App
has the dedicated App service principal and its grants.

### Enable MLflow tracing (optional)

Tracing turns on when MLflow has **both a destination and an experiment** — set one of each, in
whichever form you have. The app code needs no change; MLflow resolves the specific value.

- **Destination:** `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` (e.g. `"databricks"`) or `MLFLOW_TRACING_DESTINATION`
  (an experiment id or a `catalog.schema`).
- **Experiment:** `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_ID` or `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME`.

Set neither half → tracing stays off. Examples:

- **Local:** `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="databricks"` + `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_ID=<id>` (or `..._NAME=<name>`)
  in `.env`, pointing at an experiment in the workspace your profile targets.
- **Deployed:** set the same env in `app.yaml` and attach an `experiment` resource (its `valueFrom`
  binding injects `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_ID`).

When both halves are present the agent enables MLflow autolog (`mlflow.langchain.autolog()`) and tags
each trace with the session id. Otherwise it disables tracing outright, so the per-request span
`runtime/runtime.py` opens has nothing to export and no traces are created.

### Enable durable state (optional)

By default the agent uses an in-process LangGraph checkpointer (`InMemorySaver`) — multi-turn and
human-in-the-loop pauses work within a running process but do not survive restarts or span replicas.

Set **`AGENT_SESSION_STORE`** to a managed [Session Store](../../README.md) name and
`databricks_mason/langgraph/session_store.py` returns a `DatabricksSessionStoreSaver` instead. It's a LangGraph
`BaseCheckpointSaver` that serializes each checkpoint into ordered **session items** and stores them
through the managed Session Store **REST API** — no database the app connects to directly. Full graph
state — including paused HITL runs (pending writes + interrupts) — is durable across restarts and
replicas, over RPCs only. No agent code changes; the checkpointer swap is the only difference.

> The saver is adapted from the first-party `databricks_agent_client.langgraph` prototype, over a
> small vendored REST client (`databricks_mason/runtime/session_store_client.py`) so the template needs no
> unpublished dependency. Swap both for the published package when it lands. The store must already
> exist; access uses the caller's normal Databricks auth (the deployed app's service principal, or
> your profile locally — whichever the Session Store grants).

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE` | `DEFAULT` | Auth profile used to call the model (local dev) |
| `PORT` | `8000` | Port the server listens on |
| `AGENT_MEMORY_STORE` | _unset_ | Managed memory store ID → registers `remember`/`recall` long-term-memory tools |
| `AGENT_MEMORY_ACTOR_ID` | `agent` | Actor partition used by memory tools |
| `AGENT_SESSION_STORE` | _unset_ | Managed Session Store name → durable checkpointer (REST-backed); unset = in-process `InMemorySaver` |
| `AGENT_SESSION_ACTOR_ID` | session id | Actor used by the durable saver |
| `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` | _unset_ | Trace destination (e.g. `databricks`). A destination + an experiment enables tracing |
| `MLFLOW_TRACING_DESTINATION` | _unset_ | Alt destination — experiment id or `catalog.schema` (either destination var works) |
| `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_ID` | _unset_ | Experiment to trace to (by id) |
| `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME` | _unset_ | Experiment to trace to (by name; alternative to the id) |

## Notes

- **The event serialization in `agent/agent.py` (`_serialize_events`) is LangGraph-specific** — it
  turns LangGraph's native `astream` events into JSON dicts without reshaping them into another
  contract. **`runtime/runtime.py` is SDK-agnostic** — it hosts any agent exposing the
  `invoke_handler`/`stream_handler` dict contract.
- **Background mode is in-memory** (`databricks_mason/runtime/background.py`, wired in `runtime/runtime.py`) —
  non-durable, single-process; see the note under the client contract.
