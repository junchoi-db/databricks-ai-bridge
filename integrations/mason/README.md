# `databricks-mason`

Mason is an experimental CLI for Databricks custom agent preview APIs and
deployments. It manages memory, sessions, tracing, and deployments from one
authenticated command.

> The underlying APIs are in preview and may need workspace enablement.

## Installation

From PyPI:

```sh
pip install databricks-mason
```

From source:

```sh
pip install 'git+https://github.com/databricks/databricks-ai-bridge.git#subdirectory=integrations/mason'
```

For tracing commands, install Mason with tracing extras:

```sh
pip install 'databricks-mason[tracing]'
```

For the OpenAI Agents SDK runtime adapter in an existing project:

```sh
pip install 'databricks-mason[runtime-openai]'
```

## Authentication

Mason uses [Databricks authentication](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/cli/authentication).
If you do not already have credentials, authenticate a named profile first. You can
then ask Mason to validate and remember that profile:

```sh
databricks auth login --profile <profile>
mason login --profile <profile>
mason sessions stores list
```

`mason login` does not create credentials; it stores the selected profile in
`~/.mason/config.json`. `mason logout` forgets that selection without revoking the
underlying credentials. If Databricks SDK default authentication is already configured,
you can skip `mason login`. You can also pass `--profile/-p` for an individual command.
Use `--output json` for scripting.

## Python SDK

The same memory and session APIs are available programmatically through
`MasonClient`, which authenticates exactly like the CLI (a `.databrickscfg` profile
or the SDK's default resolution):

```python
from databricks_mason import MasonClient

client = MasonClient(profile="my-workspace")  # or MasonClient() for default auth

store = client.create_memory_store("my-store")
print(store.name, store.display_name)  # typed attribute access

client.create_memory_entry("my-store", actor_id="alice", path="/notes/1.md", content="hi")
for entry in client.list_memory_entries("my-store", actor_id="alice").entries:
    print(entry.path, entry.content)
```

Each method maps to one `/api/agents/v1` operation. Responses come back as typed
models (`MemoryStore`, `Session`, `SessionItemList`, ...) that expose attribute
accessors (`store.name`) while remaining plain dicts underneath — so `store["name"]`,
`json.dumps(store)`, and any new server-side fields keep working. API errors raise
`databricks_mason.AgentCliError`. Deployment, sandbox, and tracing remain CLI-only.

## Command help

Use the conventional help flag at any command level. Every command's help includes runnable
examples:

```sh
mason --help
mason deploy --help
mason sessions items append --help
```

For the shortest path from a blank directory to a running and deployed agent:

```sh
mason login --profile my-workspace
mason init my-agent
cd my-agent
mason dev
mason deploy my-agent
```

## Agent tools

Agent code and its SDK objects are the source of truth. `mason init` writes template provenance to
`.mason/project.toml` and an ordinary Python selection registry at
`agent/databricks_tools.py`; it does not create `agent.toml`.

The existing tool commands add Databricks Sandbox, managed MCP, and UC Function descriptors to
`DATABRICKS_TOOLS`. The CLI never imports customer code or mutates a live agent object. After each
change it prints the exact definition line and either the exact attachment line or the one-line
framework snippet the user still needs to add:

```sh
mason tools add sandbox --scope table:samples.nyctaxi.trips  # defaults to --auth user
mason tools add mcp system.ai.web_search                     # defaults to --auth user
mason tools add uc-function catalog.schema.lookup_ticket
mason tools list
```

Choose integration identity when the tool is added. `MCPService` and `Sandbox` default to
`auth="user"`; Mason writes that choice explicitly and, for a deployed App, requests the
`ai-gateway` user API scope so Apps can forward the caller's credential. After that scope is added
or changed, browser/workspace callers may need to leave and re-enter the App and consent again;
programmatic callers must refresh an OAuth token covering the App's requested scopes. A deployed
user-auth integration without that scoped forwarded credential fails closed.

Use `--auth app` only for deliberate workload identity. It means the dedicated Databricks App
service principal, never the App creator. Every caller with App `CAN USE` can potentially exercise
that principal's downstream grants, so restrict `CAN USE` accordingly or separate the App. User-auth
integrations cannot run in background mode because the request credential must not outlive the
request. Phase-1 OpenAI Agents SDK human-in-the-loop pauses are likewise unsupported with user-auth
integrations. UC Function keeps its existing App/default credential path, and customer MCP servers
from `build_mcp_servers()` keep their explicitly configured credentials.
In `mason dev`, both modes use the selected local profile because no Databricks App service
principal exists; local `auth="app"` therefore does not reproduce deployed App-SP permissions.

Both Mason templates include an active construction seam. An empty registry is a credential-free
no-op, so the source diff from `mason tools add` is the activation change. The LangGraph template
also checks remote names against its local and memory tools:

```python
local_tools = [*all_tools(), *memory_tools()]
tools = [
    *local_tools,
    *await load_tools(
        DATABRICKS_TOOLS,
        extra_servers=build_mcp_servers(),
        workspace_client_for=request_auth.client_for,
        existing_tools=local_tools,
    ),
]
```

The OpenAI template binds in its request-scoped streaming path, which is also used by synchronous
invocations. Its `AsyncExitStack` owns the MCP connections:

```python
agent = await bind_tools(
    agent,
    DATABRICKS_TOOLS,
    stack=stack,
    workspace_client_for=request_auth.client_for,
)
```

For a bring-your-own agent, attach the generated registry once at the framework's agent-construction
boundary. Mason reports `Configured, not attached` and prints the appropriate LangGraph or OpenAI
Agents SDK snippet when it cannot find that explicit seam. It does not guess a customer symbol or
silently patch their loop. A legacy Mason `agent.toml` must be migrated to `DATABRICKS_TOOLS`; the
CLI does not support it as a second source of truth. An unrelated customer-owned file with the same
name is not an agent integration contract. For a BYO project whose framework cannot be inferred,
pass `--framework langgraph` or `--framework openai`.

Discover the MCP Services available to your user before adding one. By default Mason lists the
Databricks-managed services in `system.ai`; pass `--schema catalog.schema` for another Unity Catalog
schema. Text output includes a copyable add command, while `--output json` returns normalized service
records for scripts:

```sh
mason mcp list
mason mcp list --schema main.tools
```

Custom Python tools do not go through `mason tools`. Write them as ordinary framework-native code.
For the LangGraph template, drop a typed `@tool` function into `agent/tools/`; `all_tools()`
auto-collects it without another registry entry:

```python
# agent/tools/lookup_ticket.py
from langchain_core.tools import tool


@tool
def lookup_ticket(ticket_id: str) -> str:
    """Look up one support ticket."""
    return f"Ticket {ticket_id}"
```

`mason dev` and `mason deploy` run that authored Python source unchanged. The
`DATABRICKS_TOOLS` registry is only for Databricks-managed integrations.

Sandbox scopes default to read-only access. Repeat `--scope` to allow more than one resource, use
`volume:` or `workspace:` for those resource types, and use `--permission read_write` only when the
agent needs writes. Every sandbox call carries this fixed downscope in MCP `_meta`, outside the tool
arguments controlled by the model.

## Initialize the chat app demo

The chat app is a LangGraph-specific init overlay, not a command that mutates an existing project.
It is included by default for `--framework langgraph`; pass `--disable-chat-app` to scaffold the
API-only backend instead.

```sh
mason init --framework langgraph \
  --profile <profile> \
  ./my-agent
cd ./my-agent
uv run start-server
```

The chat app includes synchronous, SSE streaming, background polling, Session Store, Memory Store,
and HITL resume UI. The framework-specific overlay adds `ui/`, `runtime/ui.py`, the UI-enabled
`runtime/main.py`, and UI tests.

For the full deployed demo, connect both managed stores:

```sh
mason --profile <profile> deploy mason-agent-demo --source . \
  --session mason-demo-sessions \
  --memory mason-demo-memory \
  --actor-id alice
```

(Missing stores are created automatically; pass `--no-create-stores` to require they already exist.)

The Databricks Apps `__Host-databricks-app-router` cookie is both the sticky routing key and the
application session id. The browser sends it automatically; API clients must reuse it as a cookie.
Request bodies never carry `session_id`. A localhost-only `mason-local-session` cookie provides the
same behavior outside Databricks Apps. TODO: move to `X-Routing-Key` when Apps supports it.

The generated `README.md` documents every request the client makes: config discovery, sync and SSE
invocations, background submission and polling, session transcript loading, HITL resume, and memory
entry operations. Capability colors are automatic from `/api/demo/config`; only the
sync/streaming/background transport selector is manual.
