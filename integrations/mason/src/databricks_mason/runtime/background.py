"""Background-run store — plumbing, slated to move into a Databricks SDK / durable backend.

``BackgroundRuns`` tracks in-flight ``background: true`` requests by invocation id so ``GET
/invocations/{id}`` can poll them. This default is **in-memory and single-process**: runs live in a
dict in this process, so they do NOT survive a restart and are NOT shared across replicas.

TODO: the SDK contract for managing background-run lifecycle isn't finalized. When it lands, replace
this with a shared durable store (crash recovery, cross-pod resume, surviving the ~120s Apps proxy
timeout) with the same interface — ``runtime/runtime.py`` only depends on
``start``/``complete``/``fail``/``get``.
